# Hospital Data Analytics Project

## Overview
This project contains a **synthetic hospital dataset** designed to simulate real-world healthcare data. It includes patient admissions, diagnoses, treatments, billing, and feedback. The main goal is to **practice data cleaning, analysis, and visualization** using Excel and Power BI, with insights presented in a **dashboard**.

## Dataset Description
The dataset includes the following columns:

| Column Name               | Description                                               |
|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| Patient_ID                 | Unique identifier for each patient                        |
| Admit_Date                 | Date of patient admission                                  |
| Discharge_Date             | Date of patient discharge                                  |
| Diagnosis                  | Medical condition or illness                               |
| Bed_Occupancy              | Number of beds occupied during admission                  |
| Test                       | Medical tests performed (may include multiple tests)      |
| Doctor                     | Doctor assigned to the patient                             |
| Followup_Date              | Date for scheduled follow-up (may be missing)             |
| Feedback                   | Patient feedback (may include missing or inconsistent data)|
| Billing_Amount             | Total charges for the hospital stay                        |
| Health_Insurance_Amount    | Amount covered by insurance                                 |

> Note: The dataset is **synthetic** and does not contain any real patient data.
